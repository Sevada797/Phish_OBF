# Phish_OBF
A phishing page setup helper, for obfuscated rendering, for overall browser anti-detection

Tool for educational purposes, it is basic obfuscation for rendering via base64.
UTF-8 support I'll add up a bit later (url-encode then b64-enc, so all chars will be supported).

It is for quick phishing setup,
## **Pros:**
Bypasses chrome phishing detection ✅️ 

## **Usage**
Paste your index.html code, type in split count e.g. 3, (helpful if one-file-upload size is limited for free hostings)
Click "Obfuscate", copy the code given in index.html, and other downloaded files ```split${n}.txt``` drop in root directory.
