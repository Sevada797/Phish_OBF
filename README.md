# Phish_OBF
A phishing page setup helper, for obfuscated rendering, for overall browser anti-detection

Tool for educational purposes, it is basic obfuscation for rendering via base64.
UTF-8 support I'll add up a bit later (url-encode then b64-enc, so all chars will be supported).

It is for quick phishing setup,
Pros:
Bypasses chrome phishing detection ✅️
